# Dynamic Visualization using R Shiny

This is a visualization project developed in R using the Shiny package. The main focus was to explore R Shiny and understand the various functionalities it offers. 

I deployed the project as a live webapp at https://jindalpankaj.shinyapps.io/causes_of_death_all_countries/ and wrote a brief blog post about it here: https://jindalpankaj.com/2020/05/01/visualization-using-r-shiny/.
